        <h1>Hello World and Welcome to my Neighborhood!</h1>
        <h3>I live in BayRidge, Brooklyn NY</h3>

        <p>
            Bay Ridge is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of the 
            New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded by Sunset 
            Park to the north, Dyker Heights to the east, the Narrows and 
            the Belt Parkway to the west, and Fort Hamilton Army Base 
            and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the south. The section 
            of Bay Ridge south of 86th Street is sometimes considered 
            part of a sub-neighborhood called Fort Hamilton.

            Bay Ridge was formerly the westernmost portion of the town of 
            New Utrecht, comprising two smaller villages: Yellow Hook to 
            the north and Fort Hamilton to the south. Yellow Hook was named 
            for the color of the soil and was renamed Bay Ridge in December 
            1853 to avoid negative connotations with yellow fever at the time; 
            the name Bay Ridge was chosen based on the local geography. 
            Bay Ridge became developed as a rural summer resort during the 
            mid-19th century. The arrival of the New York City Subway's Fourth 
            Avenue Line (present-day R train) in 1916 led to its development 
            as a residential neighborhood. Until the early 1970s, Bay Ridge was 
            dominated by its Norwegian community, but by the early 21st century 
            it had a large Arab, Irish, Italian, and Greek population.
