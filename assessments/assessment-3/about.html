		<h1>About</h1>
		
		<p id="bob-ross">
			Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. 
			And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. 
			This is an example of what you can do with just 
			a few things, a little imagination and a happy 
			dream in your heart. This is truly an almighty 
			mountain. A tree needs to be your friend if you're 
			going to paint him. Brown is such a nice color. 
			This is where you take out all your hostilities 
			and frustrations. Clouds are free they 
			come and go as they please. Zip. That easy.
			- <em>Bob Ross</em>
