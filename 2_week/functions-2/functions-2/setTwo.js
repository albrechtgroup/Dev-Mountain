/*
  You'll be writing a higher order function that returns
  another function. 

  Create a function called addingFactory that takes in
  one parameter (it will be a number).

  addingFactory should return a function that takes in
  one parameter (this will be another number).

  The (inner) function that's being returned should add
  the two parameters together and return the sum.
*/

// CODE HERE

// one line with no parentheses
const addingFactory = x => y => x + y

// it's a little easier to wrap your head around it like this
const addingFactory2 = (x) => (y) => x + y;

// and here's a more straightforward syntax of the same thing
const addingFactory3 = x => {
    return function(y) {
        return x + y
    }
}


/*
  Now that you have addingFactory, you can create other
  functions from it. 

  You're going to invoke addingFactory and save the result
  to a new variable. 

  Create a variable called addTen and set it equal to 
  the invocation of addingFactory passing in the number
  10 as an arguemnt.
*/

// CODE HERE

const addTen = addingFactory(10)

/*
  Now the inner function is stored in the addTen variable! 

  Call the addTen function passing in another number and
  console log the result.

  Call it a second time, passing in a different number
  to see the different outputs.
*/

// CODE HERE

console.log(addTen(5))
console.log(addTen(5789))

/*
  Let's make another function from the addingFactory. 

  This time, pass in your favorite number and name
  the variable addNUMBER with the name of the number
  you chose. 

  Once you create that, you can invoke the function
  to add any number to your favorite number!
*/

// CODE HERE

const addFour = addingFactory(4)

console.log(addFour(4))
console.log(addFour(4444444))

/*
  Write a function called getUserById that takes in three parameters: an array of objects (users), an id and a callback, and searches for the user with a matching id.
  When the correct user object is found, invoke the callback with the user object as an argument.
